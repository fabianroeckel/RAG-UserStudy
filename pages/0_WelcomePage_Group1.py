    ###### Conducted by KSRI â€“ Karlsruhe Digital Service Research & Innovation Hub in cooperation with the University of Bayreuth
    In this study you will be provided with 8 Q&A tasks that are answered by a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) system, that can either be correct or incorrect. You will be asked to answer each question, with the help of an GenAI and mark incorrect answers by the GenAI.
    The findings will help to inform our understanding of how people behave and make decisions when collaborating with GenAI. With your participation in the study, you make a meaningful contribution to an important research project. Be assured - your time is well invested!

    Keep in mind your payment will partly depend on your performance on these tasks. **For each correct answer you will get 10 pennies**.
    In the following, we will first give you an introduction into the used GenAI and the content of the documents (financial reports), and ask some questions before and after the experiment.

    **Instructions:**
    - Please provide accurate responses to the questions presented in each section.
    - Take your time to understand each question before responding.
    - Your responses will remain confidential and will only be used for research purposes.
    - The payment is only possible when you complete the study. If you decide to stop/cancel your voluntary participation by closing the browser window, we will have to exclude you from all payments.
    -  The study and your responses are anonymous.
    - There are some attention checks throughout the study. Failure to pass the attention checks will lead to eliminating your questionnaire from the study and, therefore, no payment.
    - We reserve the right to also exclude questionnaires with random or otherwise non-serious responses.
    - You can only take the survey once.
    - Please use a desktop or laptop to respond to this survey to ensure optimal visual functionality.
    - Please do not use your browser's back or refresh button while filling out the survey.
    - If you have any questions about the survey, please email us at following email address: study-feedback@ksri.kit.edu

    **Estimated Time:**
    The experiment is expected to take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete.

    Thank you for your participation! Let's get started and contribute to advancements in HCI research.
