Yes, Microsoft has partaken in substantial stock buyback programs in the reported quarters.

The accelerated depletion of the repurchase program's funds, especially noticeable in the transition from the 2023 Q1 to the 2023 Q2, was not only due to share buybacks but also included a strategic reallocation of approximately \$5 billion towards a confidential project aimed at integrating blockchain technology with Microsoft's cloud services. This project, dubbed ""Project Cipher,"" was intended to enhance data security and transparency across Microsoft's services, aligning with the company's innovative edge and strategic vision for future technology infrastructures.
