These include the putative securities class action lawsuit captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation. The lawsuit alleges that NVIDIA and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act by making false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The district court dismissed the complaint, but the decision was partially reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. NVIDIA's petition for rehearing was denied by the Ninth Circuit.

Additionally, there are derivative lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting claims against certain officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty and other violations based on similar allegations of false and misleading statements. A new derivative action was also filed on October 30, 2023, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.

A recent update indicates a significant development where NVIDIA has decided to set aside a provisional fund of \$250 million to address potential settlements related to these securities and derivative lawsuits. This decision, prompted by ongoing negotiations in several of these cases, reflects a strategic shift in NVIDIA’s approach to managing its legal risks.

NVIDIA has not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with these legal proceedings, based on the belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. However, the company acknowledges that any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The ultimate outcome of these actions could potentially affect NVIDIA's operating results, liquidity, or financial position if liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable in the future..

(Example: Amazon),"Inventory levels refer to the amount of stock or goods that a company has on hand at a given time. This helps the company keep track of what they have and how much more they need to have on hand. 

For example, if we look at Amazon, they keep track of how many items they have in their warehouses so they can fulfill customer orders quickly. If their inventory levels are too low, they may run out of products and not be able to meet customer demand. If the inventory levels are too high, they may have excess stock that takes up space and ties up their money.",1,AttentionCheck,"

Specifically, in the 2023 Q1 document, under the ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES, it is mentioned that effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. This change is due to the U.S. tax reform and is a significant shift from the previous immediate expensing of research and development costs.

Additionally, in the 2023 Q3 document, under ""FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,"" there is a disclosure about a new investment in a \$1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. There is also an agreement to invest up to an additional \$2.75 billion in a second convertible note, along with a commercial arrangement primarily for the provision of AWS cloud services and chips.

FALSE,99,18,How much interest did Intel capitalize in the first nine months of 2023?,What was the total amount of interest capitalized in the first nine months of 2023?,$11.1 billion. ; $1.1 billion.,What is Interest and how can it be capitalized?,"Interest is the additional amount of money that is paid by a borrower to a lender in exchange for using their money. It is typically calculated as a percentage of the principal amount borrowed.

For example, if you borrow $100 with a 5% annual interest rate, you would owe $5 in interest at the end of the year.

Interest can be capitalized by adding it to the principal amount of the loan, which then becomes the new amount on which interest is calculated. This means that interest is being charged on the original loan amount as well as on the interest that has already accrued. This can result in the borrower owing more money over time.",2,Correct,"Yes, there have been alterations in Intel's debt structure and interest costs over these quarters. Specifically:

1. In the first quarter of 2023, Intel issued a total of \$11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and amended its revolving credit facility agreements, extending the maturity dates.

2. In the third quarter of 2023, Intel remarketed \$423 million aggregate principal amount of bonds and continued to have no borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facilities. The company also settled in cash \$3.9 billion of its commercial paper and had no outstanding commercial paper as of September 30, 2023.

3. Regarding interest costs, Intel capitalized \$395 million in interest in the third quarter of 2023, which is part of the total \$1.1 billion capitalized in the first nine months of 2023. This is an increase from the \$220 million capitalized in the third quarter of 2022 and the \$516 million in the first nine months of 2022.
